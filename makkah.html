         <h1>Mecca</h1>
         <p id="mecca-txt">
            Makkah is the birthplace of Muhammad. The Hira cave atop the Jabal al-Nur ("Mountain of Light") is just outside the city and is where Muslims believe the Qur'an 
            was first revealed to Muhammad.[4] Visiting Makkah for the Hajj is an obligation upon all able Muslims. The Great Mosque of Makkah, known as the Masjid al-Haram,
            is home to the Ka'bah, believed by Muslims to have been built by Abraham and Ishmael, is one of Islam's holiest sites and the direction of prayer for all Muslims
            (qibla), cementing Makkah's significance in Islam.
            Muslim rulers from in and around the region long tried to take the city and keep it in their control, and thus, much like most of the Hejaz region, 
            the city has seen several regime changes, which owes to its rich history. The city was finally conquered in the Saudi conquest of Hejaz by Ibn Saud and his 
            allies in 1925. Since then, Makkah has seen a tremendous expansion in size and infrastructure, with newer, modern buildings such as the Abraj Al Bait, the world's
            fourth-tallest building and third-largest by floor area, towering over the Great Mosque. The Saudi government has also carried out a destruction of several 
            historical structures and archaeological sites,[6] such as the Ajyad Fortress. Non-Muslims (Kuffar) are strictly prohibited from entering the city

         <h1 id="sub-title">Under the Quraish</h1>
         <p id="mecca-txt">
            Some time in the 5th century, the Ka'bah was a place of worship for the deities of Arabia's pagan tribes. Makkah's most important pagan deity was Hubal, 
            which had been placed there by the ruling Quraish tribe.and remained until the Conquest of Makkah by Muhammad.[citation needed] In the 5th century,
            the Quraish took control of Makkah, and became skilled merchants and traders. In the 6th century, they joined the lucrative spice trade, since battles elsewhere 
            were diverting trade routes from dangerous sea routes to more secure overland routes. The Byzantine Empire had previously controlled the Red Sea, but piracy had
            been increasing.[citation needed] Another previous route that ran through the Persian Gulf via the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was also being threatened by
            exploitations from the Sassanid Empire, and was being disrupted by the Lakhmids, the Ghassanids, and the Romanâ€“Persian Wars. Makkah's prominence as a trading
            center also surpassed the cities of Petra and Palmyra.The Sassanids however did not always pose a threat to Makkah, as in 575 CE they protected it 
            from a Yemeni invasion, led by its Christian leader Abraha. The tribes of southern Arabia asked the Persian king Khosrau I for aid, in response to which he
            came south to Arabia with foot-soldiers and a fleet of ships near Makkah.
            By the middle of the 6th century, there were three major settlements in northern Arabia, all along the south-western coast that borders the Red Sea, in a habitable
            region between the sea and the Hejaz mountains to the east. Although the area around Makkah was completely barren, it was the wealthiest of the three settlements with
            abundant water from the renowned Zamzam Well and a position at the crossroads of major caravan routes.

            <blockquote> The generals who had called Zia a mullah behind his back felt ashamed at having underestimated him: not only was he a mullah, he was a 
               mullah whose understanding of religion didn't go beyond parroting what he had heard from the next mullah. A mullah without a beard, a mullah in a
               four-star general's uniform, a mullah with the instincts of a corrupt tax inspector
